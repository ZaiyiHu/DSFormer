# DensityToken: Weakly-Supervised Crowd Counting with Density Classification
* This repository is the official implementation of our method DSFormer(Dual Supervision Transformer). In this work, we propose a transformer-based weakly-supervised crowd counting framework with density tokens to perform density classification.
